The Cardiff Model for Violence Prevention has proven effective at linking public safety and well-being to community-wide collaboration and strategic coordination. However, many violent crimes and overdoses go unreported since people fear identity disclosure, humiliation, and misuse of their personal information. All of which are detrimental to crisis prevention and weaken response efficacy overall.
 
The urgency of this work is reflected in cases like [Iyisha Keller](https://archive.investigativereportingworkshop.org/news/trend-in-health-workers-falling-victim-to-opioids/), a nurse at UT Southwestern Medical Center, who was found unconscious in the hospital's bathroom with a syringe labeled fentanyl in her arm. She was moved to the emergency room, where she was pronounced dead by her work colleagues. The project presentation is titled, What‚Äôs in a Name: The Impact of Anonymous AI Voice-Reporting on Drug Overdoses and Violent Crimes, seeks to build a secure, cross-disciplinary reporting tool grounded in the Cardiff Model methods. 

Iyisha's story serves as confirmation that drug overdoses and violent crimes can happen unexpectedly to anyone. To those who knew her, there were no warning signs. Her life embodied joy, excellence, patience, kindness, and humilty, and her death overturned assumptions about the typical signs and symptoms of substance misuse and addiction. [What followed in the aftermath](https://www.dea.gov/press-releases/2021/11/30/ut-southwestern-pay-45-million-resolve-alleged-controlled-substance-act) stunned observers nationwide. The United States Department of Justice's Drug Enforcement Administration launched a 3-year investigation into the hospital's internal and external policies, procedures, and safeguards instituted to protect its constituants from crimes of theft and controlled-substances diversion. The investigation brought to light the hospital‚Äôs serial negligence and egregious violatons in disregard of the Controlled Substances Act, resulting in a $4.5 million federal settlement, the largest drug-diversion penalty in Texas and the second largest in the U.S. at the time. 

The federal government's involvement sent a clear message: Institutional accountability in healthcare settings is a concerted and collaborative effort, which demands adherence to both legal standards and ethical responsibilities. Hospitals are expected to act decisively to protect their patients and employees alike, but management of complex standards throughout large systems is a breeding ground for inter-angency collapse. As the opioid crisis continues to impact communities, regulatory compliance becomes an essential strategy for preventing harm and maintaining public confidence in our system nationwide. If justice is at stake, if freedom is threatened, if lives are on the line, if the crime is preventable, if liberty is questioned, if safety is compromised, if dignity is at risk, if privacy is breeched, if trust in society is broken, if silence is deadly, then everyone in the community is a stakeholder.

Iyisha didn‚Äôt fit the stereotype of a person battling addiction. That is the problem. From 2018-2025, over 670,000 deaths by overdose or violent crimes occured in the United States. That number represents Alaska's entire population, and more than enough to be worthy of new solutions and a catalyst for change. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to remain anonymous.

# Project Background Objective :lab_coat: :stethoscope: :pill: 
This project integrates the Cardiff Model's data-sharing principles with modern speech-to-text AI technologies (Whisper, NLP Cloud) to enable anonymous, accessible, and compliant reporting of overdose and violent crime events.

**Workflow Stages:**
1. Voice input (victim or witness)
2. ASR processing and real-time anonymization
3. Consent layer with GDPR/HIPAA-aligned protections
4. Secure, encrypted data routing
5. Stakeholder dashboards (healthcare, EMS, law enforcement)
 Next, we searched through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) for datasets discussing symptoms, diseases, and demographics. Given the limited number of open datasets that included our list of criteria in one file, we were challenged with locating and comparing multiple datasets discussing the same diseases and symptoms. We found two datasets matching the criteria to meet our project goals. [Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning?resource=download) and [Disease Prediction through Symptoms](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usamag123/disease-prediction-through-symptoms/code) Finally, we preprocessed and cleaned our datasets, queried the data, built a full-stack web application, linked our machine learning model, Tableau Visualizations, an About Us page, and created an engaging and informative slide deck presentation [HEALTHhOUSE Slide Deck Presentation](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGAo4miO1A/pu0g0g1_Bt2ud6xsoSsdug/view?utm_content=DAGAo4miO1A&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=editor)

# Analysis :bar_chart: :green_apple: :fountain_pen:
Data is everywhere. The amount of data points at our disposal for consideration and analysis is expansive, immeasurable, and uniquely complex. Technology has proven to be a powerful tool assisting clinicians in determining a patient‚Äôs probability of acquiring specific health conditions and diseases. The likelihood that one will experience either an illness, sickness, or other medical condition is inevitable. With this in mind, our group selected healthcare as our topic of interest to explore how predictive analytics could be used to accurately determine which disease a person would likely have, given the symptoms they selected in the algorithm. Data science influences advancements and innovations, creating meaningful changes based on reliable outcomes that improve life quality. As progress in machine learning algorithms continues and new technologies emerge concurrently, we can also ensure efficacy, validity, and accuracy improvements. Predictive modeling working in tandem with personalized medicine has advantages, such as empowering healthcare practitioners to deliver targeted treatment and interventions that will enhance patient healthcare outcomes and satisfaction. Using tools like HEALTHhOUSE's Disease Discovery Tool would be a wise investment, offering quick and easy health checks from the comfort of your home. After all, your health is your wealth!
